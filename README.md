# Machine Learning
This repo contains my solution to all the programming assignment of Machine Learning(Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. It is a great course for beginners to the ml field. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
